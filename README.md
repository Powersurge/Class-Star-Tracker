# Class-Star-Tracker
A web-based application that allows teachers or instructors to enroll students, track their progress, &amp; award stars based on student performance or behavior. Using audio fingerprinting technology (via the Meyda library), the app records and matches students' unique audio samples, awarding stars with a simple button press or by holding the spacebar.
