A web-based application that allows teachers/instructors to enroll students, track their progress, & award stars based on student performance or behavior.

- Award stars for student performance, with the ability to add or remove stars.
- Undo actions to revert changes.

The app also includes a back-to-top button for easy navigation and a clean, user-friendly interface for managing student data.
